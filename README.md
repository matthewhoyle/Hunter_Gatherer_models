# Persistence of Infectious Diseases in Hunter Gatherers

The traditionally held belief that most modern infectious diseases emerged when humans began living in larger agricultural settlements has been challenged by studies of modern hunter-gatherers. This study will investigate which emerging pathogens may persist in hunter-gatherer groups by constructing a compartment model of infectious disease transmission that accounts for demography and multi-band structure. This study will look to understand how the critical community size required to sustain an outbreak is affected by host population dynamics. We show that metapopulation structure increases the probability of a respiratory pathogen with waning immunity persisting after 3 years. The probability of persistence increases with the number of sub-populations but is largely determined by the duration of immunity. Understanding the origins of infectious diseases is an important area of research that will lead to improved strategies for reducing their global burden.
